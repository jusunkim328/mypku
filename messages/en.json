    "whatIsPku": "What is PKU?",
    "whatIsPkuContent1": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare inherited metabolic disorder. People with PKU cannot properly break down an amino acid called phenylalanine (Phe), which is found in most protein-containing foods.",
    "whatIsPkuContent2": "With proper dietary management, people with PKU can live healthy, normal lives. The key is keeping phenylalanine levels within a safe range through careful food choices and regular monitoring.",

    "whatIsPhe": "What is Phenylalanine?",
    "whatIsPheContent1": "Phenylalanine (Phe) is an essential amino acid found in almost all protein-rich foods such as meat, fish, eggs, dairy, nuts, and beans. Even grains and some vegetables contain small amounts.",
    "whatIsPheContent2": "For people with PKU, the goal is to eat only the prescribed amount of Phe each day. Your healthcare team will set a daily Phe allowance based on individual tolerance.",

    "howPkuAffects": "How does PKU affect the body?",
    "howPkuAffectsContent1": "When Phe builds up in the blood, it can affect brain development and function. This is why early detection through newborn screening and consistent dietary management are so important.",
    "howPkuAffectsContent2": "With treatment, most negative effects can be prevented. Regular blood tests help ensure Phe levels stay within the target range.",

    "understandingLevels": "Understanding Phe Levels",

    "faq_eatNormally_a": "People with PKU follow a special low-protein diet. Most high-protein foods (meat, fish, eggs, dairy, nuts) are restricted. However, many fruits, vegetables, and specialty low-protein products are available. With planning, meals can be varied and enjoyable.",
    "faq_highPheFoods_q": "What foods are high in Phe?",
    "faq_highPheFoods_a": "Foods highest in Phe include meat, fish, poultry, eggs, cheese, milk, nuts, beans, and soy products. Aspartame (an artificial sweetener) also contains Phe and should be avoided. Grains contain moderate amounts.",
    "faq_whatIsFormula_q": "What is PKU formula?",
    "faq_whatIsFormula_a": "PKU formula is a special medical food that provides protein (as Phe-free amino acids), vitamins, and minerals without phenylalanine. It's essential for proper nutrition since the PKU diet restricts natural protein sources. Common brands include PKU Anamix, Phlexy-10, and Kuvan.",
    "faq_testFrequency_q": "How often should blood Phe be tested?",
    "faq_testFrequency_a": "Testing frequency depends on age and stability. Newborns and infants are typically tested weekly. Children may be tested every 1\u20132 weeks. Adolescents and adults usually test monthly. Your metabolic team will recommend the right schedule.",
    "faq_canBeCured_q": "Can PKU be cured?",
    "faq_canBeCured_a": "Currently, PKU cannot be cured, but it can be effectively managed through diet and, in some cases, medication (such as sapropterin/Kuvan). Research into new treatments including gene therapy is ongoing. With proper management, people with PKU lead full, healthy lives.",
    "faq_highLevelsEffect_q": "What if Phe levels get too high?",
    "faq_highLevelsEffect_a": "Temporarily elevated levels happen and shouldn't cause panic. Return to your prescribed diet and consult your metabolic team. Persistently high levels can affect concentration, mood, and over time may impact cognitive function. Regular monitoring helps catch issues early.",
    "faq_isHereditary_q": "Is PKU hereditary?",
    "faq_isHereditary_a": "Yes, PKU is an autosomal recessive genetic condition. Both parents must carry the gene for a child to have PKU. If both parents are carriers, there's a 25% chance with each pregnancy. Genetic counseling can provide more personalized information.",

    "health_brain": "Brain & Mental Health",
    "health_brain_fact": "Research shows that elevated Phe levels over time can affect white matter in the brain — the \"wiring\" that connects different brain regions. This may lead to difficulties with concentration, processing speed, and mood regulation.",
    "health_brain_positive": "Consistent Phe management protects your brain. Studies show that people who maintain their diet have cognitive outcomes similar to the general population. Even those who return to diet after years off it often report improved concentration and mood.",
    "health_brain_tip": "Track your Phe daily and notice how you feel. Many people find a clear connection between their levels and mental clarity.",

    "health_bone": "Bone Health",
    "health_bone_fact": "Studies have found that some adults with PKU may have lower bone density. This can happen when the diet isn't well-balanced or when formula — which provides essential vitamins and minerals — is skipped.",
    "health_bone_positive": "With proper formula intake and a well-balanced PKU diet, bone health can be well-maintained. Vitamin D and calcium from your medical formula play a key role. Regular monitoring helps catch any changes early when they're easiest to address.",
    "health_bone_tip": "Take your formula consistently — it's your primary source of calcium, vitamin D, and other bone-building nutrients.",

    "health_heart": "Heart Health",
    "health_heart_fact": "Some research suggests that poorly managed PKU may be associated with changes in cardiovascular health over time, including blood pressure. These findings are still being studied.",
    "health_heart_positive": "A well-managed PKU diet, naturally rich in fruits and vegetables, is one of the most heart-friendly diets. Combined with regular physical activity, your dietary management actively supports cardiovascular wellness.",
    "health_heart_tip": "Your PKU diet is naturally rich in fruits and vegetables — embrace it as one of the healthiest ways to eat for your heart!",

    "health_kidney": "Kidney Health",
    "health_kidney_fact": "There is emerging evidence that long-term elevated Phe levels may put extra strain on the kidneys. Some studies have noted a higher occurrence of kidney-related concerns in PKU patients over time.",
    "health_kidney_positive": "Staying well-hydrated and maintaining Phe within your target range helps protect your kidneys. Your metabolic team monitors kidney function through routine blood work — early awareness leads to early action, and most concerns are preventable.",
    "health_kidney_tip": "Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Good hydration supports kidney health and helps your body process amino acids efficiently.",

    "health_nutrition": "Nutritional Balance",
    "health_nutrition_fact": "PKU formula isn't just a protein replacement — it's a carefully designed source of essential vitamins and minerals (iron, zinc, B12, vitamin D, and more) that are difficult to get from a low-protein diet alone. Skipping formula can lead to gaps in nutrition over time.",
    "health_nutrition_positive": "Taking your formula as prescribed ensures you receive complete, balanced nutrition. Think of it as your daily multivitamin and protein source in one. Many people who return to consistent formula use report feeling more energetic overall.",
    "health_nutrition_tip": "Set formula reminders on your phone. Consistency matters more than perfection — even taking most of your daily doses makes a meaningful difference.",

    "health_metabolic": "Weight & Metabolic Health",
    "health_metabolic_fact": "Some people with PKU who go off their diet may compensate by eating more carbohydrate-heavy foods, which can lead to weight gain and increase the risk of metabolic issues over time.",
    "health_metabolic_positive": "A well-planned PKU diet provides balanced nutrition. Working with your dietitian to find satisfying low-Phe meals helps maintain a healthy weight. The growing variety of specialty low-protein products makes it easier than ever to enjoy diverse, balanced meals.",
    "health_metabolic_tip": "Explore new low-Phe recipes and specialty products. A varied diet keeps things interesting and helps you stay on track.",

    "health_tip_label": "Tip",
    "health_encouragement": "You're doing something powerful by managing your PKU. Every formula dose taken, every meal tracked, and every blood test completed is an investment in your long-term health. It's never too late to start or restart — your body responds positively to good management at any age.",
